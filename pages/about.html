    <h2 >OUR MISSIONS</h2>
    <p> There's this notion that to grow a business, you have to be ruthless. But we know there's a better way to grow.<br>
    One where what's good for the bottom line is also good for customers.<br>
    We believe businesses can grow with a conscience, and succeed with a soul — and that they can do it with inbound.
    That's why we've created a platform uniting software, education, and community to help businesses grow better every day.

<h2 >OUR STORY</h2>
     <p> As fellow graduate students at VIT in 2020, Austin, Faizan and Varun noticed a shift in the way people shop and buy. Consumers were no longer tolerating interruptive bids for their attention
    <br> — in fact, they'd gotten really, really good at ignoring them.
     <br> From this shift, a company was born: FAV STORE. It was founded on "inbound", the notion that people don't want to be interrupted by marketers or harassed by salespeople — they want to be helped.
    <br>Today, the inbound movement continues to empower businesses around the world to stop interrupting, start helping, and return their focus to the customer.
